# Unbound configuration file for Debian.

# Configuration for a local caching, forwarding and DNSSEC-validating resolver.
#  - Can be switched from forwarding to recursive by commenting out the
#    `forward:' section.


# The configuration is based mostly on the documentation in unbound.conf(5), as
# of debver 1.13.1-1.
#  - All references to defaults, configuration or Debian refer to this version,
#    unless otherwise noted.
#  - It is also written with the defaults depicted there in mind.
#    - Many (most?) options are deliberately kept at their default.
#      - Some of them appear nevertheless, some commented, some not.
#  - It was originally written based on the documentation for debver
#    1.9.0-2+deb10u2.  All changes in the documentation were taken into
#    account.
#  - Any other sources of information, which are generally specified locally,
#    were found on the www at the time when debver 1.9.0-2+deb10u2 was current
#    in Debian stable.
#
# It works together with
#  - a custom systemd service file,
#  - a custom script to update the root trust anchor on start, if necessary.
#
# Additionally:
#  - Some of the relevants RFCs were consulted (for basic understanding).
#    - They are generally much better than any of the other explanation in the
#      www.  Truly.
#  - Some www-published configurations were looked at.
#    - No important choice was made exclusively by their example.
#
# The example configuration [example-config] was ignored.
#
# Notes:
#  * The default configuration file includes /etc/unbound.conf.d/*.
#    * That directory is non-empty, by default, in Debian.
#    * It is not included here.
#  * Quotes are generally from unbound.conf(5).


# If optimization is desired, see [NLNET:optimise].
#
# Also, probably unbound.conf(5):
#  - *-slabs
#  - num-threads (n_cpus)
#  - cachedb
#  - aggressive-nsec


# If much logging is desired, consider `dnstap'.  See
#  - unbound.conf(5): dnstap-*
#  - https://dnstap.info
#  - https://blog.apnic.net/2020/12/17/dsc-and-dnstap-allow-you-to-monitor-all-the-dns/

	## Sandboxing

	# Explicitly set user (default).
	username: unbound

	# chroot
	#  - Notes:
	#    * /var/lib/unbound seems to be foreseen on Debian.
	#      * The upstream suggestion is `/etc/unbound'.
	#        * Since the directory generally contains mutable data, this
	#          seems like a bad idea.
	#    * This requires /dev/urandom (and /dev/log) to be present in the
	#      chroot directory.  Handled by the systemd service.
	#      * /dev/log should only be required when logging to syslog.
	#      * Also: The pidfile, unless disabled (see systemd service),
	#        should be accessible.
	#    * All other "absolute" paths are relative to this directory,
	#      unless they are prefixed with this directory, in which case the
	#      respective paths are relative to `/'.
	chroot: /var/lib/unbound

	# Working directory.
	#  * Use the default (/etc/unbound) in order to allow usage of the
	#    somewhen (probably dpkg post-installed) created files
	#    /etc/unbound/unbound_{control,server}.*.
	#    - The systemd service bind-mounts (read-only) /etc/unbound into
	#      the chroot directory.
	#      - The Debian preconfiguration would copy that directory before
	#        service start.

	## Logging

	# Default verbosity.  "operational information"
	#  - Note: To completely disable logging "once daemonized", set
	#    `logfile' to "".
	#    - Unsure of the effect if we never daemonize.
	#  - Note: To properly completely disable logging, the best option
	#    seems to be `logfile: /dev/null'.
