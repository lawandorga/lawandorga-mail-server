# Essentially taken from Debian's default `/etc/profile' (2021-03-25),
# with small adjustments and some additions.
# Notably, changed order of sourcing `/etc/profile.d/*' and `bash.bashrc'.


# Note: Debian does not seem to set the umask explicitly in any of the default
#       shell-sourced files.  Parabola sets it here.  Seems like a good idea.
