127.0.0.1	localhost

# Map hostname and FQDN to an IPv4 address.
#
# Notes:
#  * If we are not behind a NAT and have a static public IPv4 address:
#    * We should specify our public IPv4 address here.
#  * If we are behind a NAT and get a dynamic IPv4 address via DHCP:
#    * We should specify `127.0.1.1`.
#      * This follows a suggestion by [0].
#      * Mapping the FQDN to this local IP address is debatable.
#        * [0] recommends to use the FQDN here if we have one *and* we have a
#          static IP address.
#        * hosts(5) has this exact configuration line listed in its example
#          configuration.
#        * We map our FQDN to something else than what it resolves to in the
#          DNS (which is the NAT's public IP address).
#        * It seems to work well, however.
#  * Note that the above two cases are not exhaustive.
#    * Nothing is being said about the remaining cases.
#  * The point of adding the FQDN here is to have `hostname -f` return it.
#    - Some software depends on this.
#  * The hostname should be the same as in `/etc/hostname`.
{{ network.primary.ipv4.address }}	{{ fqdn }} {{ hostname }}

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts.
::1		localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0		ip6-localnet
ff00::0		ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1		ip6-allnodes
ff02::2		ip6-allrouters
