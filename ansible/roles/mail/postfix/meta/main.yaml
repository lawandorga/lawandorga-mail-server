  # We want/need
  #  - a local DNSSEC validating resolver
  #    - to verify DANE TLSA records,
  #    - for OpenDKIM.
  #      - See `..//templates/opendkim/opendkim.conf.j2`.
  #  - a local resolver, for SPF checking performance.
  #    - See policyd-spf(1)#PERFORMANCE_CONSIDERATIONS.
  #    - SPF, like most DNS related things, does also benefit from DNSSEC.
