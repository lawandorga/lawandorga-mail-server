# Static (non-db) aliases (and sender login maps).
#  - See
#    - `/doc/mail/postfix/aliases/static.md`,
#    - `/doc/mail/postfix/aliases.md`.
#  - This map is used both in
#    - ${virtual_alias_maps}, and
#      - See postconf(5)#virtual_alias_maps, virtual(5).
#    - ${smtpd_sender_login_maps}.
#      - See postconf(5)#smtpd_sender_login_maps.
#    * We have to make sure that the format is compatible with both.
#      - See also postmap(1) (this is (the source of a) "hash" database).
#  - This file must be processed by postmap(1) to be usable.
#  - See also BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.


# Rules (self imposed)
#  * LHS
#    * Only statically configured domains of ours.
#      * Aliases for database domains are configured in the database.
#      * We do not want to rewrite addresses for foreign domains.
#    * Format
#      - a) "user@domain"
#      - b) "@domain"
#      - not: "user"
#        - Reason(s):
#          - This matches for any domain in $myorigin, $mydestination,
#            $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces.
#            - E.g., user@[<proxy-addr>] would be accepted.
#          - We generally only want mail to be accepted that is destined to a
#            virtual [alias] domain.
#        - exception: `postmaster`.  See `/doc/mail/postfix/aliases/static.md`.
#  * RHS
#    * Only statically configured domains of ours.
#      * Why not external domains:
#        * We do not have SRS configured, so aliasing inbound mail to an
#          outbound address may break due to SPF.
#        * This may be a privacy issue.
#      * Why not dynamic (database) domains:
#        * This configuration is static and should thus not depend on dynamic
#          configuration.
#    * Format: "user@domain"
#      - SASL login names have this form.
#      - The other formats have no special meaning for
#        ${smtpd_sender_login_maps}.


# Accept mail for postmaster (and allow sending as them).
