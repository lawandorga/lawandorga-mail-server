# Notes:
#  * This only works for locales available by default (C.UTF-8, C, POSIX).
#    - These available locales are Debian-specific.
#      - In particular, C.UTF-8 is commonly not available on other distros.
#    - We want UTF-8.
#    - There's not really a point in allowing configuration.
#  * The destination path is also Debian-specific.
