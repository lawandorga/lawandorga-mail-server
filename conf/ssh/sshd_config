# OpenSSH server configuration.
#  * History:
#    - Originally written for debver 1:7.9p1-10+deb10u2 (2021-03-05).
#    - Revised 2022-09-21 for debver 1:8.4p1-5+deb11u1.
#      - Considered:
#        - [releasenotes]
#        - maybe: changes in sshd_config(5) man page
#    - Revised 2023-09-05 for debver 1:9.2p1-2.
#      - Considered:
#        - changes in sshd_config(5) man page
#        - /usr/share/doc/openssh-server/NEWS.Debian.gz
#        - /usr/share/doc/openssh-server/changelog.Debian.gz
#          - This basically contains [releasenotes].
#    * Note: There may have been other changes, independent of version updates.
#  * Most security-relevant values are explicitly set.  That is, as long as no
#    new options are added or modified and none of the used crypto breaks, the
#    below settings should be fine.
#  * All options considered, see sshd_config(5).
#  * Additional, secondary guides used:
#    - See references at the bottom + other links below.


# General notes:
#  * Prefer positive settings, whenever possible.
#    * I.e., prefer "allow" over "deny".
#  * Prefer very restrictive settings.
#    * We do not expect many different people to connect.
#    * Can always be changed per host/user / in Match blocks.


# Debian-specific options:
#  * `DebianBanner`
#  * `GSSAPIKeyExchange`, `GSSAPIStoreCredentialsOnRekey`,
#    `GSSAPIKexAlgorithms`
#    - That's not all of the `GSSAPI*` options.
#    - Fedora should also have (most of?) these.
#    - See also <https://github.com/openssh-gsskex/openssh-gsskex>.

## Crypto & host authentication

# General notes on crypto selection:
#  * OpenSSH uses OpenSSL for many but not all of its crypto.  The following
#    settings should rely exclusively on OpenSSH's own crypto and work for
#    OpenSSH compiled with `make OPENSSL=no`.
#    - <https://it.slashdot.org/story/14/04/30/1822209/openssh-no-longer-has-to-depend-on-openssl>
#    - <https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=139879453001957&w=2>
#    - <https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc?content-type=text/plain>
#  * Others' recommendations:
#    - [stribika]
#    - [Bettercrypto]
#    - [CERT NZ:sshd]

# Notes on public key algorithms:
#  * ECDSA is questionable.  Hence, do not use it.
#    * <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#ECDSA> + referenced links
#    * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ipsecme-safecurves-03#section-4>
#    * <https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/>
#  * Both Ed25519 and RSA are fine.
#    * One is sufficient.  Half the attack surface.
#    * RSA requires OpenSSL, Ed25519 does not.
#    * Choose Ed25519.
#  * Notes on RSA:
#    * Do not use the `ssh-rsa*' algorithm.  It uses SHA-1, which is broken.
#      * Instead, use `rsa-sha2-512*' (or `rsa-sha2-256*').
#      - <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>
#    * Use sufficiently long keys.
#      * Best, 4096; 2048 may be considered acceptable.

HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# This is not actually relevant, we do not use certificates.
CASignatureAlgorithms ssh-ed25519

# Notes:
#  * Only relevant if RSA allowed somewhere.
#  * sshd_config(5) does not mention this applying to a host RSA key.
RequiredRSASize 4096

# Notes:
#  * Without OpenSSL, we are basically limited to Curve25519 (optionally
#    combined with sntrup761 (post-quantum crypto)).
#    - These are considered very good options.
#  * We prefer, but do not require the post-quantum crypto option.
#    - It is at least as secure (because combined with Curve25519).
#    - It is not widely supported, notably not in Debian Bullseye.
#    - It is not unlikely to be replaced in a close future OpenSSH release.
#  * If allowing Diffie-Hellman KexAlgorithms, modify `/etc/ssh/moduli'.

#    - The former is an AEAD cipher, which is preferred.

## Client authentication & authorization

PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

# See also the later section "Privileged users & groups".
AllowGroups ssh-users-nopty

# Only allow public key authentication.
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
HostbasedAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
KerberosAuthentication no
GSSAPIAuthentication no

# Positively set the authentication method(s).
#  * Note: This setting allows to require multiple [combined] authentication
#    methods.
AuthenticationMethods publickey

# Enable PAM.
#  * The main function of this setting is to "enable PAM authentication using
#    KbdInteractiveAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication"
#    (sshd_config(5).
#    - These are both disabled, however.
#  * This allows "disabled" accounts to connect.
#     - Accounts created with useradd and w/o explicitly set password are
#       "disabled" (more precisely: /etc/shadow: "!").
#     - To circumvent that, this value can be changed e.g. to '*', which is a
#       a common value for system users.  (useradd -p '*')
#       - <https://arlimus.github.io/articles/usepam/>
#       - /etc/shadow
#       - shadow(5)
#  * This initializes the environment [stosb], in particular sets LANG.
#    - This could otherwise be done via /etc/profile.d, for example.
#  * Other arguments: <https://serverfault.com/questions/669458/whats-the-downside-of-disabling-pam-in-openssh-if-only-public-key-login-is-allo/669464#669464>
UsePAM yes

# Put authorized_keys in `/etc', only give write-access to root.
AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u

# Don't trust the DNS on anything.
UseDNS no

# Note:
#  * This denies access if $HOME is owned by root (and $USER != root).
#    * This could be a reason to disable this.
#    * SFTP is unaffected.
StrictModes yes

# Less time for attacks.
#  * Value as suggested by [CERT NZ:sshd].
#    * I did not find any suggestion anywhere of a lower value.
#  * This should probably make more difficult, e.g., the attack described here:
#    - <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>
#    - <https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2>
#    * Note that this attack does not affect us.
LoginGraceTime 10

# Suggested by [CERT NZ:sshd].
MaxAuthTries 1

# "Disable connection multiplexing which can be used to bypass authentication"
#  - [CERT NZ:sshd]
MaxSessions 1

# Notes:
#  * The default MaxStartups should be fine.  I simply do not know a good
#    value; hence, I left it as is.
#  * See also: `PerSourceMaxStartups`, `PerSourceNetBlockSize`.

# Restrict access to potentially sensible log messages (default: AUTH).
#  - Note: If logging to the systemd journal, the access is not actually
#    differentiated by syslog facility.
#  - Note that sshd_config(5) does not list AUTHPRIV as an option.
#  - Suggested by: [Mozilla] [CERT NZ:sshd]
#  - Suggested otherwise by: [Bettercrypto] (AUTH)
#  - See also:
#    - <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/59525/difference-between-authpriv-and-auth#answer-59530>
#    - syslog(3)
SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV

# INFO should be enough.  VERBOSE does not harm though.
#  - Also, VERBOSE is suggested by [CERT NZ:sshd].
#  - Note: In some older OpenSSH version, the log-level VERBOSE was required to
#    log key fingerprints.  [Mozilla]

## Misc

# This stuff is shown post-authentication.  Be boring anyways.
PrintMotd no

## SFTP

# Notes:
# * Reasons to enable:
#   * `scp` uses SFTP by default, nowadays.
#   * Ansible wants to copy files via SFTP.
# * See also sftp-server(8).
# * There is a difference between `internal-sftp` and `sftp-server`.
#   See sshd_config(5).

###############################
## Privileged users & groups

# See also the global AllowGroups setting.
#  - The idea is that
#    - there, a single group is allowed access which gets all the above
#      "default" permissions.
#      - That group is to use for users that should have classic SSH access
#        but nothing fancy.
#    - here, distinct groups are given more or less permissions than the
#      "default" group.
#    - any group suffices to give SSH access of some kind.
#      - I.e., membership in several groups is usually not required
#      - In particular, SSH users need not be in the "default" group.

# For interactive shell access, one wants a pty.
Match Group ssh-users-pty
	AllowGroups ssh-users-pty
	PermitTTY yes
